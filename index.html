            <img src="assets/images/Headshot.jpg" id="headshot" alt="headshot"><br>
            <p>My name is Valerie Susnick. I have been practicing as a Speech-Language Pathologist for the past 8 years across both the educational and healthcare settings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over these years I have accumulated experience working with Assistive Technology. This technology encompasses anything that helps an individual to participate in their daily lives with greater independence - low-tech to high-tech.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently I serve as an Augmentative-Alternative Communication Specialist in a pediatric hospital setting. I help individuals with severe communication impairments, who have difficulty using natural verbal speech, find a voice - usually via a speech generating device (SGD).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the companies whose technology I have recommended include TobiiDynavox, Saltillo, and Prentke Romich. Their devices utilize a variety of access methods including touchscreen, eye gaze, peripheral switches, and infrared headpointing. Many of the patients I work with also have physical impairments that limit their ability to use their hands. So having alternative access methods is very important for these individuals. Their physical impairments impact their ability to utilize much of the technology we take for granted - like smartphones and tablets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am hopeful that through the UPenn Coding Bootcamp, I will acquire a deeper knowledge of how to make technology more accessible to these individuals. I'd like to move into more of a development role with this type of technology where I can apply my first-hand knowledge of the patient's needs.</p>
